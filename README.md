# School District Analysis
## Overview
### This report was prepared for the Chief Data Scientist of the city school district. This analysis assessed the nature and quality of student-specific and school-specific data including student names, student math and reading scores, school budget, school budget per student and the school type (charter or district school). This report yields some insight into school performance, cost effectiveness and comparative performance. The data for Thomas High School was determined to be of questionable honesty so I made a partially successful effort to recalibrate the data for better accuracy.
## Results
### District Summary
As shown in the table below there are 15 total schools comprised of just under 40,000 total students. The district's total budget is approximately $24.6 million. A range of average math and reading scores are also available.
